# GameTameDealFinder
This is a suite of Python scripts intended to maximize Steam Market profit attained from the GameTame offer-based site.  
It works by maintaining a MySQL database containing the information for every item provided on the site, and putting GameTame's "point price"  alongside the real price on the Steam Market so that discrepancies could be capitalized on.  
  
However, I eventually found out that GameTame updates its internal point prices every time one goes to purchase an item, and thus the entire concept was uprooted.  
Nonetheless, the experience gained from pursuing the project was invaluable.
